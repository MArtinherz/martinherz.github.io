      <description>Well, the season&amp;rsquo;s over. My bracket finished 7th in our pool and placed solidly in the 82nd percentile. That was a surprise given how the first day went where my bracket was in last place. The high placement for myself is due to having a Gonzaga-Baylor national championship or the two best teams all seasons all year.
That may be an obvious pick but hey, millions of people did not pick the two best teams to make the national championship.</description>
