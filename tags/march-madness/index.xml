      <description>Well, the season&amp;rsquo;s over. My bracket finished 7th in our pool and placed solidly in the 82nd percentile. That was a surprise given how the first day went where my bracket was in last place. The high placement for myself is due to having a Gonzaga-Baylor national championship or the two best teams all seasons all year.
That may be an obvious pick but hey, millions of people did not pick the two best teams to make the national championship.</description>

      <description>This past weekend has not been kind to many brackets. My bracket right now ranks in the 72.5 percentile after the first weekend, a shock after being last after day one.
That doesn’t make me feel right but something is up when your bracket jumps from last to above the majority.
